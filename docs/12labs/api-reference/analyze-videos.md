# Analyze videos

The Analyze API suite analyzes videos and generates texts on their content. The Analyze API suite offers three distinct endpoints tailored to meet various requirements. Each endpoint has been designed with specific levels of flexibility and customization to accommodate different needs.

* [`/gist`](/v1.3/api-reference/analyze-videos/gist): For topics, titles, and hashtags using predefined formats.
* [`/summarize`](/v1.3/api-reference/analyze-videos/summarize):  For summaries, chapters, and highlights, allowing customization with a prompt
* [`/analyze`](/v1.3/api-reference/analyze-videos/analyze): For open-ended text, requiring clear instructions in the form of a prompt to guide the output.
