# Python SDK

{/* <Info title="Important">

The 1.3 version of the API includes significant improvements and introduces breaking changes. If you are using v1.2, refer to the [Migration guide](/v1.3/docs/resources/migration-guide) page for a detailed list of changes, migration instructions, and code examples.

You must use SDK version 0.4.x or later to access API version 1.3.

The [TwelveLabs Python SDK](https://github.com/twelvelabs-io/twelvelabs-python) provides a robust interface for interacting with the TwelveLabs Video Understanding Platform. It simplifies authentication and efficiently processes asynchronous tasks.

<Note title="Notes">
  * This section provides an overview of the key methods and their usage. However, it is a partial list of all available methods and fields in the SDK.
  * The SDK is designed to closely follow the structure of the TwelveLabs API. In most cases, you'll find a corresponding method in the SDK for each method in the API.

# Sample applications

To get started quickly, see the sample applications below that demonstrate the capabilities of the TwelveLabs Python SDK. These applications show how to implement common use cases and the best practices for using the SDK.
