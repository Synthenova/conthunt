## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or device. This collection happens through direct interaction, automated technologies, and third parties.

Our servers automatically collect information when you access the App. This "Usage Data" is critical for us to understand how the Service is being used and to maintain its performance. It includes:

    *   **Clickstream Data**: Your navigation path through the app, including which buttons you click, how long you stay on a page, and where you drop off.

### 2.3. Financial Data
We do **not** store your full financial information (such as long-form credit card numbers, CVV codes, or bank account passwords) on our servers. All financial transactions are processed by our secure third-party payment processor, **Dodo Payments**.

### 2.4. Third-Party Data
We may obtain information about you or content relevant to your research from third-party sources, such as:
*   **Social Sign-On**: If you sign in using Google, we access your basic profile info (email, name, picture) as authorized by that provider's permissions model.
*   **Public Data**: As a content research tool, we aggregate public data from platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram via data providers like ScrapeCreators. This data is public, but we process it in the context of your research activities. We do not access private accounts on these platforms without your explicit permission and authentication.

## 3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

We use cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and other tracking technologies on our App to help customize the App and improve your experience.
